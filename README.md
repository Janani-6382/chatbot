How it Works

The user types a message in the input field and clicks the send button.
The JavaScript code gets the user's message and creates a new div element to display the message.
The code then checks if the message includes any of the emotions in the emotions object.
If an emotion is found, the code returns a random response from the corresponding list.
If no emotion is found, the code returns a default response.
The code creates a new div element to display the chatbot's response and appends it to the chat log.
